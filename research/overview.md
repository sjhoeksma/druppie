# 🔬 Research & Innovation Hub

Welcome to the Druppie Research Center. This section serves as a central repository for in-depth architectural studies, technology assessments, and feasibility reports that guide the evolution of the Druppie platform.

## 🎯 Active Research

Current investigations influencing immediate architectural decisions.

### [🤝 Microsoft 365 Copilot Integration](copilot.md)  
**Status:** `Completed` | **Recommendation:** M365 Agents SDK + Custom Engine Agent  
A comprehensive deep-dive into integrating Druppie with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. This study evaluates Declarative Agents vs. Custom Engine Agents vs. MCP integration paths, addressing authentication challenges, permission models, and hybrid connectivity options.

## 📚 Future Studies (Planned)


- **Distributed Agentic RAG:** Evaluating performance trade-offs of decentralized vs. centralized vector stores for multi-agent systems.

## 🧪 Methodology

Our research follows a structured approach to ensure technical rigor and actionable outcomes:

1.  **Definition:** Clearly stating the research question and success criteria.
2.  **Landscape Analysis:** Surveying available technologies, standards, and industry best practices.
3.  **Prototyping:** Building Proof-of-Concept implementation to validate assumptions.
4.  **Evaluation:** Assessing solutions against key metrics (performance, security, scalability, cost).
5.  **Recommendation:** synthesizing findings into a clear strategic direction.
