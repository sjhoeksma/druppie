# Agents Overview

This directory contains the definitions for the **Agents** in the Druppie ecosystem. 
Agents are autonomous entities configured with specific instructions, capabilities, and tools. They are the workforce that executes the plans generated by the Orchestrator.

## Agent Types

We distinguish between three main types of agents:

1.  **Specification Agents (Spec Agents)**:
    *   High-level thinkers responsible for planning, architecture, and orchestration.
    *   Output: Plans, Specifications, or Diagrams.
    *   Example: `Architect`, `Business Analyst`.

2.  **Execution Agents**:
    *   Specialized workers that perform specific tasks using Tools/Skills.
    *   Output: Code, Files, Content, Infrastructure.
    *   Example: `Infrastructure Engineer`, `Audio Creator`.

3.  **Native Workflows (High Performance)**:
    *   Agents where the orchestration logic has been compiled into **Native Golang Code** for maximum speed, determinism, and robustness.
    *   Marked with the `native: true` flag.
    *   They bypass the LLM Planner's step-by-step logic and execute strict, hard-coded pipelines.
    *   Example: `Video Content Creator`, `Native Workflow Engineer`.

## Structure
Each Agent file defines:
- **Metadata**: Name, ID, Version, Native Flag.
- **Workflow**: A Mermaid State Diagram defining the execution logic (especially for Native Workflows).
- **Instructions**: The System Prompt.
- **Skills/Tools**: Allowed capabilities.
